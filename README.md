# React + Vite

Link :- https://lottery-game-in-react.netlify.app/

Created a lottery game in React that generates a random 3-digit number when a "Generate Ticket" button is pressed. When a "Check Result" button is pressed, the game checks if the sum of the digits of the generated number equals 15. If it does, the player wins; otherwise, the player loses and can try again.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
